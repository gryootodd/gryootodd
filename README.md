hihi!! You can call me Mafuu, although my friends usually call me Agustin or Zander, since I use those names a lot (｡•́︿•̀｡) 

he / him 𐙚

I'm 15 years old, I'm turning 16 this year, so I'm still a minor.  

I may be too bipolar, my mood changes suddenly, so I'm sorry in advance for that 

੭ I love everything that has to do with otome games! (obey me, collar x malice, amnesia, mistyc messenger ... and more)

I also really like role-playing games, rhythm games... and many more! In fact, I can like anything that catches my attention. 
I am a **big** fan of j-pop (I love MafuMafu so much, osaru and yuu miyashita) , vkei, gothic lolita, jirai kei + jirai dansha :3

♱**DNI**: basic criteria of Dni, Just don't be weird with me, please. I may not like some fandoms, but I can tolerate them

♡ ‎◝ I love my best friends, they are my pookies (gonzalo, sam and Ethan)
